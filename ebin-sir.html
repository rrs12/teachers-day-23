        I wanted to say thanks for being such a fun teacher. You make learning about best out of waste really enjoyable.
        Your enthusiasm and seriousness about it are great. It's cool how you show us how to make useful things from
        stuff that would otherwise be thrown away. I'm learning a lot from you, and it's not boring at all. According to
        me the best part of the WE classes is when you mimic Aryan and destroy him by a few words
