    <div class="text">When I entered the classroom in April, I was taken aback to find you as my teacher. I had heard
        that you were quite strict and emphasized discipline, and I was unsure about how I would manage throughout the
        entire year in class 9-D. However, as the academic year unfolded, I came to understand that your strictness was
        intended for those who required it. I genuinely appreciate your teaching style in English, the occasional
        motivation you provide, and especially your efforts to instill discipline in us.
        <br><br>
        I want to express my heartfelt gratitude, sir, for all the hard work and dedication you put into your teaching.
        Thank you!</div>
