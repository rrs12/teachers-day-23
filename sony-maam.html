    <div class="text">Upon entering the classroom in April, I was taken aback to find you there. I had heard about your reputation for
        strictness and discipline, which left me uncertain about how I would navigate the entire year in 9-D. However, as
        the academic year unfolded, I came to understand that your strictness was reserved for those who required it. I
        truly appreciate your teaching methods in English, your occasional motivational talks, and your particular emphasis
        on instilling discipline.
        <br>
        I extend my heartfelt gratitude to you, sir, for your unwavering dedication and efforts!</div>
