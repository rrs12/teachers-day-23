    <div class="text">Biology was the subject that I was most feared of. I used to think that I would only have to rote
        learn it to score in exams. And in the 1st or 2nd biology session I was drinking juice and you scolded me for
        it, I thought how would I spend this year learning bio with this teacher, she is very strict. But it was not so,
        the way you teach eliminates 70% of rote learning. Your notes make learning even better.
        <br><br>
        P.S. : Your voice is so melodious that during the initial biology classes, it felt like a lullaby, almost
        lulling me to sleep. Then, suddenly, you would raise your voice, either scolding someone or shouting, jolting me
        awake. In the starting of the session, I was too scared of you because you scolded Aarav and me very badly last
        year because we pinched Devansh during Science Club class.</div>
