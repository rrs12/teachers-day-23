        In Python, I had practical coding skills but lacked a solid theoretical foundation. I had even forgotten some
        fundamental definitions. However, your explanation of these concepts made them remarkably clear, and I believe
        they are now firmly ingrained in my memory. One of the standout aspects of your classes is the freedom to
        discuss and explore any topic without constraints. Your teaching style aligns with our preferences, and I
        sincerely appreciate your willingness to accommodate our requests and deliver instruction with excellence. Thank
        you, ma'am, for your dedication to our learning experience.

        P.S.: I don't know why, but every 2nd or 3rd class, we engage in online games once our practical work is
        completed. You either don't seem to notice or choose not to reprimand us for it. I want to express my gratitude,
        ma'am, for your understanding and leniency in this matter. Thank you.
