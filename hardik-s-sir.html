    <div class="text">Sir, first of all I hope you are in the pink of your health and you are recover quickly. You are one of
        the best teachers I’ve ever come across. When you had the accident, I didn’t believe it until Ekta ma’am broke the
        silence. I believe everyone in the class prayed for you each and every day for your recovery. I almost cried when
        you came back and talked about health. I could see you one the verge of crying which made me emotional. Thank
        you, sir for teaching us Maths and Physics with perfection. Your notes and guidance help a lot. Again, I hope
        you get fully recovered quickly.
        <br><br>
        P.S. : In the blue house meeting for selecting the nominees, I was sad because I did not become a nominee but at
        the same time I was very happy because you urged a few teachers to make the nominee and took my stand. Thank you, sir for that.
