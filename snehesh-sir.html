        I want to take a moment and share with you how grateful I am to you for explaining the concepts of geography in
        such a clear manner. The notes that you provide us with are a life-saviour. Also, I am interested in your
        classes because you connect each and every thing with real life examples along with the experiences of yours
        that you share. Thank you teaching History in such a way that we don't need to learn it. You really teach
        history like a story. I would like to thank you for making the classes so lively by making fun of the “notorious
        kids”.
        <br><br>
        P.S. : Thank you ma'am for stop taunting me for the “Parv” incident and pleaseeeeee make us play musical chair
        as soon as possible. Can't wait to eat your yummy food 😋😋</div>
