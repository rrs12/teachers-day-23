        Cricket is my dream and I wanted to our school to be CBCA affiliated, but it didnâ€™t happen. But I appreciate the
        effort you put into organizing the cricket selections in our school. It allowed us to showcase our talents and
        grow as individuals. Thank you sir for every bit of your effort to make our favourite period even better.
        <br><br>
        P.S.: One of the most amusing incidents at school occurred when you mistakenly believed a
        primary school student had referred to you as "Principal." Your embarrassed reaction went unnoticed by everyone
        except for me. And please allow me to bat in the next selections ðŸ¤£
