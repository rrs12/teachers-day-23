        I wanna say a big thanks for letting me sing, even though you know my voice isn't the best. Your never-ending
        backing and cheering, even when I hit wrong notes, really means a lot. Your kindness, generosity, and endless
        patience have made this experience even better, and I'm truly grateful for that. Your strong belief in my
        "singing" is super heartwarming and, obviously, loaded with sarcasm.</div>
