        I want to say a big thanks for letting me sing, even though you know my voice isn't the best. Your never-ending
        backing and cheering, even when I hit wrong notes, really means a lot. Your kindness, generosity, and endless
        patience have made this experience even better, and I'm truly grateful for that. Your strong belief in my
        "singing" is super heartwarming.</div>
